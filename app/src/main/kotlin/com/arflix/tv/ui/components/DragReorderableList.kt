/**
 * Touch reordering for a [androidx.compose.foundation.lazy.LazyColumn]: press and hold any row,
 * then drag it. The held row floats above the list while the others make room for it.
 *
 * Three properties make this different from the hand-rolled drag handles elsewhere in the app
 * (playlists, portals, catalogs), and they are the reason this lives in its own file:
 *
 *  1. **The gesture is keyed to the row's key, never to its position.** A row that moves while the
 *     finger is still down keeps the same key, so the gesture survives every step. Keying on the
 *     index cancels the gesture after the first move, which limits the user to one position per
 *     press.
 *  2. **No row height is ever assumed.** Every position is read from [LazyListState.layoutInfo],
 *     so rows of different heights, and rows that change height, stay under the finger.
 *  3. **The list scrolls itself** while a row is held against the top or bottom edge, which is what
 *     makes lists longer than one screen reorderable at all.
 *
 * The held row is drawn at the position the finger put it, expressed in the list's own viewport
 * coordinates. Its translation is recomputed from the live layout on every frame rather than
 * accumulated, so the row never jumps when the underlying order arrives a frame or two late -
 * which it does here, because the order is persisted before it comes back through the UI state.
 *
 * Usage:
 * ```
 * val listState = rememberLazyListState()
 * val reorderState = rememberDragReorderState(listState) { key, from, to -> /* move one step */ }
 * LazyColumn(state = listState, userScrollEnabled = reorderState.draggedKey == null) {
 *     items(rows, key = { it.id }) { row ->
 *         Row(modifier = dragReorderItem(reorderState, row.id)) { /* ... */ }
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 * While a row is held the list is taken off the finger (`userScrollEnabled`): it still scrolls, but
 * only by itself, at the edges, which is the only scrolling that belongs to a move.
 *
 * ⚠️ The list must not use a top `contentPadding`: row offsets and the finger position are compared
 * in the same coordinate space, and top padding shifts the two apart.
