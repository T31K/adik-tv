/**
 * A constant timing correction for an auto-matched subtitle: a cue authored at media time `t` is
 * displayed at `t + offsetMs`.
 *
 * Applied live in `AiSubtitleRenderersFactory`'s offset renderer rather than baked into the served
 * file, so a correction needs no MediaItem rebuild.
 *
 * A linear *drift* term (`rate`, for a 25 fps subtitle over 23.976 fps video) used to live here
 * alongside the offset, fitted from reference samples taken at several points in the file. It was
 * removed in Sept 2026: it never once produced a usable fit in testing (it needs three collinear
 * anchors to tell drift from a re-cut, and real files gave two), and measuring it required sampling
 * far ahead of playback — which only the headless second player could do, and that player was
 * itself removed for costing ~260 MB of heap. Correcting drift now would need a trigger that costs
 * nothing when there is no drift, e.g. noticing a verified subtitle drift out later in the file.
