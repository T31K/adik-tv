/**
 * Placeholder URL for a Stalker VOD source.
 *
 * A Stalker portal never hands out a playable URL, only a `cmd` token that has
 * to be exchanged for one via `create_link`. Doing that while building a source
 * list would fire one portal request per candidate, so a matched movie carries
 * this marker instead and `StreamRepository.resolveStreamInternal` exchanges it
 * exactly once, when the user actually starts playback.
 *
 * Shape: `stalker_vod://<portalId>/<urlencoded cmd>`, with `?series=<number>`
 * appended for an episode. The portal id travels inside the marker so a
 * multi-portal setup always resolves against the portal the entry came from.
 *
 * Movies and episodes deliberately share one scheme: an episode differs from a
 * movie by a single `create_link` parameter, not by how it is played, so every
 * place that recognises a Stalker placeholder - the playback exchange, autoplay,
 * the source ordering - keeps working on both with the one check it already has.
